# üìö Collaborative-Based Book Recommender System

This is a **Collaborative Filtering-based Book Recommendation System** where:

- The **frontend** is built using **Streamlit**
- The **backend** is powered by **Flask**
- The two are connected using **CORS**

---

## üöÄ Features

1. **Top Rated Books Page** üìñ  
   Displays the most popular books based on average user ratings.

2. **Book Recommendation Page** üîç  
   Select a book, and it shows **5 similar books** using **collaborative filtering** based on user ratings.

---

## üß† How It Works

- We created a **pivot table**: Users √ó Books with their respective ratings.
- This pivot table is used as an **embedding matrix**.
- Using **cosine similarity**, we compute the similarity between books.
- Based on this similarity, we return the top 5 recommendations for any selected book.

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python)
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Collaborative Filtering using Cosine Similarity
- **Interfacing**: CORS (Flask-CORS)
