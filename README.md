## Project Overview

The **Collaborative Book Recommender** uses collaborative filtering to analyze user preferences and suggest books that align with their tastes. This approach relies on the idea that if two users share similar reading habits, they are likely to enjoy similar books. 

The system is built using Python and integrates with Flask and Streamlit to create a user-friendly web application. Users can easily navigate the interface, input their preferences, and receive book recommendations based on their reading history and the preferences of similar users.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get book suggestions based on your reading habits.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation and interaction through a web application.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Recommendations update as you provide more input.
- **Community Driven**: The more users participate, the better the recommendations become.
- **Multiple Genres**: Recommendations span various genres, ensuring a wide selection.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing the recommendation algorithms.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the web application.
- **Streamlit**: Used to create interactive web applications for data science projects.
- **Machine Learning**: Collaborative filtering techniques to analyze user data.
- **Data Science Libraries**: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and analysis.
